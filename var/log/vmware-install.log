The communication service is used in addition to the standard communication 
between the guest and the host.  The rest of the software provided by VMware 
Tools is designed to work independently of this feature.
If you wish to have the VMCI feature, you can install the driver by running 
vmware-config-tools.pl again after making sure that gcc, binutils, make and the
kernel sources for your running kernel are installed on your machine. These 
packages are available on your distribution's installation CD.

The VM communication interface socket family is used in conjunction with the VM
communication interface to provide a new communication path among guests and 
host.  The rest of this software provided by VMware Tools is designed to work 
independently of this feature.  If you wish to have the VSOCK feature  you can 
install the driver by running vmware-config-tools.pl again after making sure 
that gcc, binutils, make and the kernel sources for your running kernel are

The memory manager driver (vmmemctl module) is used by VMware host software to 
efficiently reclaim memory from a virtual machine.
If the driver is not available, VMware host software may instead need to swap 
guest memory to disk, which may reduce performance.
The rest of the software provided by VMware Tools is designed to work 
independently of this feature.
If you want the memory management feature, you can install the driver by 
running vmware-config-tools.pl again after making sure that gcc, binutils, make
